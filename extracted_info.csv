owners of a six-storey shopping centre development situated along Upper Serangoon Road. The
respondents were the main contractors. Building works commenced in 1979 pursuant to a written
agreement between them dated 27 January 1979 (`the contract`) at a price of $10,243,091.26. The
contract incorporated, inter alia, the 1979 Singapore Institute of Architects Standard Conditions of
Building Contracts (`the SIA Conditions`). Clause 34 provides for the reference of any dispute arising
under the contract to arbitration.
During the course of and at the conclusion of the building project, disputes arose between the parties

in two appeals, namely, CA 93 and 94/97, reported in Fook Gee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit and
another action [1998] 2 SLR 121 . The two appeals arose from the decision of the High Court in two
suits, which were tried together. The first was Suit 4141/83, in which a Hong Kong company, Fook
Gee Finance Co Ltd (`Fook Gee`) claimed against one Liu Cho Chit (`Liu`) (who is the respondent in
the present appeals) the sum of US$642,451.04 as a loan. The claim was dismissed with costs by the
High Court, and against this decision Fook Gee appealed in CA 93/97. The second was Suit 4149/84,

Because of the appellant`s contacts and expertise, in December 1998/January 1999, Nagan
approached the appellant and informed him about a project for track laying works for the new North-
East MRT Line (the `project`). According to Nagan, there was a joint venture consisting of Tekken

(the joint venture is hereinafter referred to as `TUS`), which was seeking to secure the project.
Nagan asked the appellant if the latter was interested in working with TUS to carry out the project.

were a building contractor engaged by the respondents as the main contractor for the project
pursuant to a building contract (the `contract`). The contract incorporated the Singapore Institute
of Architects Conditions of Building Contract (the `SIA Conditions`). In the course of the works, the
respondents failed to make payments under five interim certificates issued by the project architect.
The appellants brought Suit 658/99 against the respondents to claim payment in respect of those five
certificates, including interest and costs. The total amount outstanding under the five certificates
was $5,469,137.04.
The respondents denied liability on two grounds. The first was that the respondents had paid $2m to
the appellants` director, Chwee Meng Chong (`Chwee`) and the appellants had agreed that this sum
would go towards reducing the amount owed by the respondents to the appellants under the interim
certificates. Secondly, the appellants had agreed that the balance of $3,469,137.04 need not be paid
until a sum of $9.46m was paid to the respondents by the appellants` associated company, How Hwa
Investment Pte Ltd. The background to the alleged two agreements is as follows.
In 1994, one Ho Mun Fei (`Ho`) and Chng Heng Tiu (`Chng`) jointly tendered for the project site and
when they succeeded, they incorporated the respondent company and assigned to it the tender
award. Chng`s company, Chng Heng Tiu Pte Ltd and his associates (the `Chng group`), including
Chwee, held 64% of the shares in the respondent company. Chwee himself held 5% of the shares in
the respondent company. The other 36% was held by Ho and his brother (the `Ho group`).
The respondents commenced the development of the project. In late 1997, there arose a dispute
between the two groups and the Ho group decided to acquire the Chng group`s 64% shareholding in
the respondents through their company, Straits International Resources Pte Ltd (`SIR`). On 1",80710,NA

On 1 March 1971, one Martin Lee, the son of the deceased, petitioned for letters of administration to
be granted jointly to himself and his sister, Christina Lee, as administrators of the estate. The order
appointing them as such was made on 12 March 1971. However, nothing more was done by both of
them and the grant was never extracted.
In 1989, Martin Lee suffered a severe stroke and became incapable of managing his own affairs by
reason of his mental disability. By an order of court dated 10 August 1994, Martin Lee`s son, the
respondent in this case, and the wife of the respondent were appointed as the Committee of his
Person and Estate (`Committee`).
Sometime on or before 20 July 1995, Christina Lee and the respondent made an application to court
to revoke the original grant of letters of administration and to appoint them as administrators of the

under the style `ONE.99 Shop`, which name was registered with the Registry of Businesses on 1
December 1995. The respondents opened their first retail outlet with that name on 6 April 1997 at
The Heeren, an upmarket shopping centre along Orchard Road. By the time of the trial, the
respondents had opened a total of seven such outlets at various shopping centres all over the island,
of which one was a franchised outlet. An important characteristic of the respondents` outlets is that
all the goods sold in the outlets, ranging from Japanese snacks and other foodstuffs to cosmetics,
fashion accessories, stationery, toiletries, common household products, plastic-ware and toys, are
priced at a fixed price of $1.99.
The person behind the respondents is one Ms Nanz Chong, the Managing Director. She is a relatively
well-known former-model-turned-entrepreneur. According to her, she first conceived the idea of a
`one-price store` following her travel to Japan in the mid-nineties in the course of her work as a
model when she noticed numerous stores there selling all items at one fixed price. She felt that this
kind of a sales concept would catch on and be popular in Singapore. So for three years preceding the
opening of the first store, she put in considerable effort sourcing for goods and preparing for the

One of the nominated sub-contractors of Lum Chang for the project was Tan Chiang Brother`s Marble

Sometime in 1995, disputes arose between Lum Chang and Anderson Land concerning the late
delivery of certain marble tiles for the project. Pursuant to an arbitration clause in the contract the
parties agreed to refer the disputes to arbitration.
At about the same time, Tan Chiang commenced Suit 1414/95 in the High Court against Anderson
Land for payment of marble tiles supplied to the project. Anderson Land applied to join Lum Chang as
third parties to the action on the ground that there were overlapping issues. The application was
granted.
On 4 August 1997, the action came up for hearing before Choo Han Teck JC. Counsel for Lum Chang
and Anderson Land indicated to the learned judge that the dispute was one which was more suitable
for arbitration. As Tan Chiang was, at that point, unwilling to have the matter resolved by arbitration,
counsel for Lum Chang orally applied for the entire matter to be referred to arbitration pursuant to s
22 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10) and for the court proceedings to be stayed. The learned judge",137208,NA
